<!--- A Brief Summary of the Project and what functionality it provides / goal it accomplishes --->
### Project Description:
The 'Cyber-WM Dark' theme collection is a variety of dark-mode styles for the XFCE Window Manager. This repository comes with 11 
color styles to choose from, making it even more likely you'll find a color to make your build stand out.

Experience a unique GUI feel with CyberwMs use of Shadow Effects which appear to change your Window shape entirely when in 
windowed mode. 

CyberWM is ported from 'ghost-dark', a Window Manager style by [Purnomoshinigami](https://www.xfce-look.org/u/purnomoshinigami).

It is originally inspired by the ColdSteel Oroborous Theme.
